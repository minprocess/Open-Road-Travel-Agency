# Open-Road-Travel-Agency


# _**Introduction**_
***
As a team, we conceived and executed a design that solves a real-world problem by integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests. We collaboratively worked on establishing an idea, built a foundation, and added the final touches to create a responsive web page. We have created a travel agency website that is mobily responsive. Upon arriving to the page you are prompted with a search bar requesting you enter the location of where you would like to travel. Using Agile Software Development practices, we met each day, indicated daily tasks to be achieved individually. Throughout the process we ran into many errors and discrepancies. While working together, we were able to solve most of the challenges and have a successful result by by getting feedback and adjusting accordingly. Our project features many technologies. We have HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. We did use the MaterializeCSS framework for our project. We worked through learning the process of git branch workflow, pull requests, merging files etc. The API's that we chose to use for our project are the Google Map API and the COVID API. Upon entering the location into the search bar it will respond by taking you to the Google map of the location. It will also interact by placing a pin to mark the city in which you chose. You will see the current weather for that city using the Open Weather API. You will also see a card show up indicating the positive daily covid cases for the given state. If there are less than 500 cases, it will reflect green, if there are 501 to 999 cases it will reflect yellow, and if it is over 1000 if will light up red.
